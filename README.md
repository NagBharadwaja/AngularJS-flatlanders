# AngularJS-flatlanders
A simple prototype built using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap that shows a sample module of cars showcase and their information.
To build this project, I have implemented the concepts of Angular JS's
1. Built-in directives,
2. Forms,
3. Custom directives,
4. Services,
5. Dependency injection,
6. Refactoring everything into individual modules.
